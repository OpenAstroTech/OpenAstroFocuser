# Sysbuild configuration for OpenAstroFocuser
#
# Builds MCUboot alongside the application and signs the application image so
# it can be chain-loaded by MCUboot.

SB_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y

# ESP32* MCUboot configs default to no signatures; override to RSA.
SB_CONFIG_BOOT_SIGNATURE_TYPE_RSA=y

# By default, sysbuild will use the MCUboot test key shipped with the
# MCUboot module when RSA is selected.
# For production, set SB_CONFIG_BOOT_SIGNATURE_KEY_FILE to an absolute path
# to your own PEM key.
